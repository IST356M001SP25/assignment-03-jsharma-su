## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

This assignment helped me get more comfortable with Streamlit and how to integrate it with existing Python modules. I now understand how to take user input in Streamlit, process it with a backend module, and display structured output dynamically. The first part, was straightforward, but I initially struggled with making sure the processing only happened when input was provided, since Streamlit re-runs scripts on updates. For handling file uploads and converting them into readable text took some trial and error, especially when iterating through lines correctly. The biggest challenge in was maintaining session state in Streamlit to track processed files and counts, but after reviewing the documentation, I got it to work. I also learned the importance of committing code in stages, which helped me keep track of changes. Overall, this assignment strengthened my understanding of interactive Python applications and file handling in Streamlit, but Iâ€™d like to improve my efficiency in debugging Streamlit apps.
